## Stereo

my implementation of camera calibration without using opencv with reference to [Z.Zhang's method](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/a-flexible-new-technique-for-camera-calibration-2/) in Python3

calibrate.py calibrates camera by using OpenCV

main.py calibrates camera without using OpenCV

left folder stores the image data source

steps folder includes the modules to implement Z.Zhang's method
